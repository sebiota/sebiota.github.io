      <h2><center>“Because I Could Not Stop for Death” by Emily Dickinson</center></h2>
      <p>
        He kindly stopped for me—<br>The Carriage held but just Ourselves—<br>Because I could not stop for Death—<br>And Immortality.
      </p>
      <p>
        We slowly drove—He knew no haste<br>And I had put away<br>My labor and my leisure too,<br>For His Civility—
      </p>
      <p>
        We passed the School, where Children strove<br>At Recess—in the Ring—<br>We passed the Fields of Gazing Grain—<br>We passed the Setting Sun—
      </p>
      <p>
        Or rather—He passed Us—<br>The Dews drew quivering and Chill—<br>For only Gossamer, my Gown—<br>My Tippet—only Tulle—
      </p>
      <p>
        We paused before a House that seemed<br>A Swelling of the Ground—<br>The Roof was scarcely visible—<br>The Cornice—in the Ground—
      </p>
      <p>
        Since then—’tis Centuries—and yet<br>Feels shorter than the Day<br>I first surmised the Horses’ Heads<br>Were toward Eternity—
      </p>
